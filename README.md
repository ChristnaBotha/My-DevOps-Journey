AWS DevOps Journey
I am a cloud-focused DevOps practitioner specializing in AWS infrastructure and automation. Transitioning from a legal career as an admitted attorney, notary public, and conveyancer in South Africa, I bring a strategic problem-solving mindset to cloud engineering.

This repository showcases my hands-on experience with AWS services, infrastructure as code, and cloud best practices. I am committed to building scalable, secure, and efficient AWS solutions while continuously refining my expertise in cloud automation and DevOps methodologies.
